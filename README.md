Steps:

1. This may seem overwhelming but don’t worry we will go in single steps. For
this step you just need to layout the structure of the first session of the
resume. This includes: an image, full name, title, general information, and a
bio. You can always go back and re-structure the html. For now, let’s think
of one possible structure for this session. Of course, you are welcome to
follow your own creative structure.
a. Think of the entire resume inside a big container, let’s call this
container “main_container”.
b. Inside the main-container, we can have a session where we can put
all the information required for this step, call it: session1
c. Now inside session1, the simplest way to see it, is by visualizing three
boxes. 1) for the image, full name, title 2) for the general information
3) for the bio
d. Go ahead and start implementing it. After, play around with the CSS.
Although we have not learned about the “display” property of CSS, it
is pretty easy to understand and we encourage you to research it.
